  <h1>Exybore's school projects</h1>
</div>

On this repository, you can explore the little projects I made for school in various fields of study : physics, engineering...

Here is the list of the projects stored on this repository :

- [arduino-traffic-lights](./arduino-traffic-lights) : Traffic lights controlled with an Arduino board

## Licenses

In principle, all the projects are under the [Do What The Fuck You Want Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because I made them for my studies, so I don't want any acknowledgement.

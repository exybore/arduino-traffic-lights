On this repository, you can explore the little projects I made for school in various (scientific) fields : mathematics, physics, engineering...

## üîê Licenses

In principle, all the projects are under the [Do What The Fuck You Want Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because I work on them for my studies, so I don't want any acknowledgement. Moreover, most of them are made with one of my classmate, so it would be jerk to get all the glory for me.

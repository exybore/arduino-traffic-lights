  <h1>Exybore's school projects</h1>
</div>

On this repository, you can explore the little projects I made for school in various (scientific) fields : mathematics, physics, engineering...

Here is the list of the projects I store on this repository :

- [arduino-christmas-garland](./arduino-christmas-garland) : A pretty and modular Christmas garland made with an Arduino
- [arduino-traffic-lights](./arduino-traffic-lights) : Traffic lights controlled with an Arduino board
- [engineering-mbot](./engineering-mbot) : Engineering class challenges using mBot robots
- [voltage-divider](./voltage-divider) : An example of a voltage divider using Simscape and Simulink

## üîê Licenses

In principle, all the projects are under the [Do What The Fuck You Want Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because I work on them for my studies, so I don't want any acknowledgement. Moreover, most of them are made with one of my classmate, so it would be jerk to get all the glory for me.

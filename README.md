  <h1>Exybore's school projects</h1>
</div>

On this repository, you can explore the little projects I made for school in various fields of study : mathematics, physics, engineering...

Here is the list of the projects I stored on this repository :

- [arduino-christmas-garland] : A pretty and modular Christmas garland made with an Arduino
- [arduino-traffic-lights](./arduino-traffic-lights) : Traffic lights controlled with an Arduino board
- [voltage-divider](./voltage-divider) : An example of a voltage divider using Simscape and Simulink

## Licenses

In principle, all the projects are under the [Do What The Fuck You Want Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because I made them for my studies, so I don't want any acknowledgement from them.

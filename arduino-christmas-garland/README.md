## 🌈 How it works

It's a very simple but fun project for this 2019 Christmas period. My main goal behind is that I want to write a clean and readable code : indeed, I saw many people doing this kind of creation but making a horrible code base...

The whole system only requires one component, in any quantity : LEDs. The program has a list of the LEDs and when they need to activate or not, and for how many time. Many modes are available, doing different things : blinking, in chain...

## 🔌 Hardware setup

Simply connect many LEDs to any pins of your Arduino board. Don't forget to add resistors so they're protected !

## ⌨ Software setup

TODO : write software setup
